Todo Syntax Hilighting
======================

A simple todo list syntax for vim. Doesn't do much, but gets the job done.

### Installation

Copy the files into your ~/.vim directory. Create a new file with a .todo extension.
   

### Syntax

.todo files follow the following format:

    Work:
      - finish README @docs
      - update makefile (joe)
      - ship it by 8/13/09
      - a completed task @done
      - write docs WTF
      x another type of completed task

    Home:
      - pay bills
      - groceries (sue)
